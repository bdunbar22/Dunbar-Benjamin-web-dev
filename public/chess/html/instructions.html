					<td>When a pawn is first moved it can go two spaces forward.</td>

				<tr>
					<td> Pawn </td>
					<td>En Passant: If an opposing pawn moved two spaces forward on its last move. And is now next to a pawn of the opposing player, the current player can move diagonally into the space that the opposing pawn skipped over and still capture the opposing pawn.</td>

					<td>Promotion: Upon reaching the other end of the board the pawn can be promoted to any piece of the same color except to a King. Extra Pieces are povided on the sides for promotion if needed.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td> King, Rook</td>
					<td>Castling: If all of the spaces between a King and a Rook are vacant, neither the King nor the Rook in question have made a move yet during the game, and movement through any of the open squares would not be the King in danger by being in "check", then the king may move two spaces towards the rook and the rook will move to the square immediately inside of the kings position. Initiate by moving King.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td> King </td>
					<td>Check: If the King is in a position such that the opposing player could capture the King on their next turn then it is in check. If a players King is in check they MUST make a move such that the King is no longer in check at the end of their turn. Note: You must watch for this. Not watched by computer.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td> King </td>
					<td>Checkmate: If one of the players King is in check and the player can not make a move such that their King is no longer in check, then a checkmate has been reached and the other player wins. In this version, the opposing player must now capture the King to see the win message.</td>
