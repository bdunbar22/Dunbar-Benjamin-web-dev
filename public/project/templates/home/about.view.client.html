                    This project will be an art sharing and critic platform for human movement.
                    It will allow for the upload of images, videos and text posts so that members can share their
                    accomplishments. The app will also allow for fun competitions, were users submit a photo or video
                    to a competition that another user has created. A judge or judge panel will then vote for a winning
                    entry. A user's profile will include how many fun competitions they have won. It will also show the
                    posts they have made and competitions they have created.

                    So... what kind of human movement am I talking about?
                </p>
                <p class="bmd-text-column">
                    The site is mainly tailored to Freerunning and Tricking. They are both ways for people to
                    perform athletic feats for fun and sometimes in competitions. There can be a lot of confusion and gray
                    lines when it comes to catorizing something as freerunning or tricking, so there will be
                    some more information about each on this page.
                    Furthermore, users won't be limited to just these catagories and may also want to share other photos or videos,
                    some examples could be yoga, parkour, martial arts or even team based sports like soccer and football.

                <h3>Freerunning</h3>
                <p class="bmd-text-column">
                    Free running can be described as a type of parkour that focuses on acrobatic moves that are mainly
                    performed to be aesthetic. The discipline itself is said to be generated by SÃ©bastien Foucan in
                    France back in 2003 due to a book he wrote. However, people have been performing acrobatics for a
                    very long time. A lot of moves in free running come from gymnastics and can also be seen in some
                    old martial arts movies. The general idea behind free running is the freedom of movement. The
                    athletes that freerun love to challenge themselves and their bodies almost anytime and anywhere. There
                    are also teams of people that perform freerunning and some athletes, like Tim Sheiff and Damien Walters,
                    are very well known from their impressive abilities.

                <h3>Tricking</h3>
                <p class="bmd-text-column">
                    Tricking is a sport that mostly came about through internet vidoes. It is a non-contact sport which
                    stems from a flashing combination of martial arts moves as well as breakdancing and gymnastics.
                    There aren't many rules to tricking and it is common for people to have gatherings at gymnastics
                    facilities to just get together with other people and perform tricks. Most of the moves that people
                    perform will include kicks, spins and flips. At gatherings people may also compete in a similar fashion
                    to breakdancing, where two people will take turns performing some moves and the crowd will cheer each
                    athlete on.
